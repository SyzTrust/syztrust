SyzTrust is an on-device fuzzing project that enables fuzzing Trusted OSes on boards as well as tracking state and code coverage non-invasively.

SyzTrust is designed for fuzzing Trusted OSes provided by IoT vendors and assumes that (i) a TA can be installed in the
Trusted OS, and (ii) target devices have ETM enabled.

The idea of this project is to fuzz closed-source, proprietary Trusted OSes on development boards. We decouple execution to offload heavy-weight tasks (e.g., ETM packet decoder, branch and state coverage calculation, seed preservation, seed selection, and mutation) to the PC. Then, we utilize a debug probe to track the instruction traces and state variable values using the Real Time Transfer (RTT) protocol. Based on the instruction traces and state variable values, we can calculate the branch and state coverage, which will be utilized to guide seed preservation and selection in the fuzzing procedure.

Our [paper](https://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings-article/sp/2024/313000a070/1RjEaG9OpTa) from Oakland '24 explains the system in more detail.



## SyzTrust Components from Implementation Perspective
SyzTrust is built on Syzkaller. We added a board controller to control a debug probe for instruction trace collection and state variable monitoring. We replace the original executor in Syzkaller with our designed CA and TA. Moreover, we implemented our designed corpus, seed preservation and seed selection components.

# Installation

## Prerequisites

* OS version as the base system: Windows (Linux should work. We use Windows because Segger has better support for Windows).
* Install Golang. Please refer to [Offical Go Installation](https://go.dev/doc/install) and [Installing Multiple Go Versions](https://go.dev/doc/manage-install). Recommend version: go1.17. (SyzTrust is written in Golang and based on Syzkaller).
* python 3.10.1 for board controller (set up a Python virtual environment named `syztrust`)
    * requirements.txt is in `${project_root_dir}/`.
    * Recommend JLink SDK version: `JLink_Windows_SDK_V766`. Please use pip to install `jlinksdk-7.66.0-py3-none-any.whl.`
* ETM version v3.5

## Configuration

Fill in `config.ini` in the board_manager directory. An example of `config.ini` is below.

**When using RTTUtils.py to check the address, you should get similar outputs as follows.**

## How to use (Take mTower as an example)

1. Use Nuvoton M2351 and connect J-Trace pro with M2351 and PC. **[Configure the hardware]: Turn on TXD, RXD, VCOM; Turn off MSG.**
    <img src="https://github.com/SyzTrust/syztrust/blob/main/Docs/Images/settings.png"  width="50%" height="30%">
2. Use Nuvoton ICP tool to load mtower_s_176.bin and mtower_ns_176.bin on M2351 board; then disconnect with ICP tool.
3. Activate `syztrust` virtual environment.
4. In `${project_root_dir}/board_manager` directory, run the following command to update the scripts in `board_manager` and generate `my.cfg` in `${project_root_dir}/` directory.
    ```shell
    python patcher.py
    ```
5. Build syztrust in `${project_root_dir}/` directory. For Windows:
    ```shell
    go build -o ./bin/trusty_arm/syztrust_fuzzer.exe ./syz-fuzzer
    go build -o ./bin/syztrust_manager.exe ./syz-manager
    ```
    For Linux (To be updated).
6. Run syztrust in `${project_root_dir}/` directory. Before running a fuzzing campaign, you should clean the workdir directory.
    ```shell
    python clean.py
    ```
    For windows:
    ```shell
    .\bin\syztrust_manager -config=.\my.cfg
    ```
    For Linux (To be updated).

# How to Contribute
As a researcher, time for coding is finite. This is why there are still TODOs which could make the SyzTrust implementation better (even if we had infinite time, there would always be more things to improve, of course). If you are interested, here are some sample projects to work on for hacking on SyzTrust:
