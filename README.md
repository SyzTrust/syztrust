# SyzTrust
SyzTrust is an on-device fuzzing project that enable fuzzing Trusted OSes on boards as well as tracking state and code coverage non-invasively.

# How to Contribute
As a researcher, time for coding is finite. This is why there are still TODOs which could make the SyzTrust implementation better (even if we had infinite time, there would always be more things to improve, of course). If you are interested, here are some sample projects to work on for hacking on SyzTrust:
